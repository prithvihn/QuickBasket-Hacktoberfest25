## ✅ Contribution Rules

* Keep PRs **small and focused** (one feature or fix per PR).
* Follow proper **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript formatting**.
* Do not remove or break existing functionality.
* Do not submit spam or invalid pull requests.
* No cosmetic changes like unnecessary spaces, punctuation edits, or unneeded rewrites.

## 💡 Good First Issues

Check out the **[Issues](../../issues)** tab for tasks labeled:

* `good first issue`
* `hacktoberfest`
* `hacktoberfest-2025`

## 🔑 Coding Style Guide

* Use **semantic HTML** (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`).
* Use **CSS classes** instead of inline styles.
* Keep JavaScript functions **modular** (avoid repetition).
* Write **clear comments** for any complex logic.

Example:

```js
// ✅ Good Example
function calculateTotal(cart) {
  return cart.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
}
```
